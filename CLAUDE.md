## Git Workflow Instructions

When performing git operations (add, commit, push), follow these important guidelines:

### Before Any Git Operations:
1. **Verify Repository Context**
   - Check that you're working in the user's repository, NOT the original upstream repositories
   - Confirm the status of `memobase` and `memobase-inspector` submodules/components

2. **Check for Upstream Updates**
   - Check if there are any updates from the original repositories
   - Inform the user about any available updates
   - Ask the user whether they want to pull and merge upstream changes before proceeding

### Git Operations:
- Use the GitHub MCP tool for all git operations
- Ensure changes are staged and committed to the correct repository
- Follow proper commit message conventions
