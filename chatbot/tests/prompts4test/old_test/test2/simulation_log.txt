       It sounds like Stella has been making positive changes in her life, focusing on physical health through running and yoga, mental well-being through reading and volunteering, and social connections through meeting new people and reconnecting with friends. She's also addressing financial stress by updating her budget spreadsheet.
      
      In the next two hours, Stella chooses total stillness to rest and recover after a long work week. She enjoys a bath with Epsom salts and orders takeout, indulging in her favorite sushi.
      
      For future social connections, it seems she's leaning towards joining a local running group or cooking class based on shared interests. This approach will help make those first steps easier. It's great that Stella is taking action to expand her social circle and continue improving her quality of life in various aspects.

      That sounds like a great plan! Starting with something that aligns with your hobbies can indeed make it more enjoyable and less intimidating. Here are some steps you could take to get started:
      
      ### For the Running Group:
      1. **Research Local Groups:**
         - Use online platforms like Meetup.com or social media groups to find running clubs in your area.
         - Check if there are any meetups happening soon that you can join as a guest.
      
      2. **Explore Events:**
         - Look for local races, runs, or group activities where you can participate and see the community in action.
         - This could help you gauge the vibe and decide if it’s something you want to commit to long-term.
      
      3. **Reach Out to Members:**
         - If there are active groups on social media, consider sending a friendly message expressing your interest in joining.
         - Joining group chats or forums can also be helpful for getting tips and advice from other members.
      
      ### For the Cooking Class:
      1. **Check Local Options:**
         - Look up local cooking classes offered by community centers, culinary schools, or online platforms like Udemy or Skillshare.
         - Some classes might even have a guest session where you can observe and ask questions before committing to full sessions.
      
      2. **Look for Community Events:**
         - Sometimes local food festivals or markets offer workshops or tasting events that are free or inexpensive.
         - Attending these events can give you an opportunity to meet others who share your interest in cooking.
      
      3. **Engage Online:**
         - Join online communities like Reddit or Facebook groups dedicated to cooking or running.
         - Participating in discussions and asking for recommendations from other members can also help you find suitable options.
      
      ### General Tips:
      - **Start Small:** You don’t have to jump into a full group or class right away. Observing first, asking questions, or participating in smaller events can be less daunting.
      - **Bring Friends Along:** If you feel more comfortable with familiar faces, consider bringing Sarah along for the first few meetings or classes.
      - **Set Realistic Goals:** Define what you want to achieve from these activities (e.g., making new friends, improving your running technique) and set small, manageable goals.
      
      ### Example Steps:
      1. **Today:**
         - Spend some time browsing local events or class offerings online.
         - Reach out to the groups on social media platforms to ask if they have any upcoming events you can join as a guest.
         - Plan which activity feels most appealing and start researching more about it.
      
      2. **Tomorrow:**
         - Attend a guest session of your chosen group or class, if possible.
         - Reflect on the experience and decide if it’s something you want to continue with.
      
      3. **Next Week:**
         - Enroll in a full course or join a regular running group.
         - Continue building connections within these communities.
      
      Taking things step-by-step will help you build your social circle gradually and ensure that the process feels manageable and enjoyable.
